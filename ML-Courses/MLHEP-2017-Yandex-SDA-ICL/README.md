Main topics:
- python, scientific python (numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
- python for data science (pandas, sklearn)
- metric models
- linear models 
- tree-based models and ensembles, in particular boosting
- dimensionality reduction
- tensor computations and neural networks (theano and keras)

## Challenges

There were two challenges during the course:

- restaraunt reviews classification
- flavour tagging of B mesons
